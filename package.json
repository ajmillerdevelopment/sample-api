  "description": "This is my technical assessment project for Hasura. For this project, I will be building an API with Node.js and Express.js which will interact with a weather database stored in MongoDB Atlas. I chose Node because JavaScript is by far my most comfortable programming language. I chose Express and MongoDB because I have experience with those platforms from my General Assembly bootcamp. Two of the projects I built there (Alex and Tom's Art Blog and Wayfarer) had Express/Mongo backends. I will host the backend on Heroku and test it using Postman. Most of the projects I've worked on since graduating from the bootcamp have been primarily frontend working with React and CSS, so I was excited at the opportunity to work in the backend again.",
